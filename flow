1. Start State
   
Action: Initialize FSM.

Transition: Proceed to the "Resolve Parentheses" state.


2. Resolve Parentheses State
   
Action: Search for the innermost pair of parentheses in the input expression.

Condition:
    Parentheses Found: Extract the sub-expression within them.
    No Parentheses: Move to the "Handle Exponent" state.
    Sub-Action (with Parentheses): Pass the sub-expression through the FSM to obtain its evaluation result.

Replace the sub-expression with this result.

Return to the "Resolve Parentheses" state to check for additional parentheses.


3. Handle Exponent State
   
Action: Process all exponentiation operations (^).

Sub-Actions:
    Identify operators from the expression and their operands.
    Apply each exponentiation operation sequentially from left to right.
    Replace each evaluated operation with its result.

Transition: Proceed to the "Handle Multiplication/Division" state.


4. Handle Multiplication/Division State
   
Action: Process multiplication (*) and division (/) operations sequentially.

Sub-Actions:
    Identify operators and operands.
    Apply each multiplication and division operation in the sequence they occur.
    Replace each evaluated operation with its result.

Transition: Proceed to the "Handle Addition/Subtraction" state.


5. Handle Addition/Subtraction State
   
Action: Process addition (+) and subtraction (-) operations sequentially.

Sub-Actions:
    Identify operators and operands.
    Apply each addition and subtraction operation in the sequence they occur.
    Replace each evaluated operation with its result.

Transition: Proceed to the "Stop" state.


6. Stop State
   
Action: Conclude FSM processing and output the final result.
